# Dockerfiles for Polish NLP

Someone trying to run any more sophisticated tools indispensable for doing NLP tasks in Polish will quickly discover
that making them run is pretty hard. Although we have a large number of tools available as Clarin services, processing a

This repository contains Dockefiles for preconfigured images of the Polish NLP tools. It's main purpose is allowing to
cut down the installation and configuration time from days to seconds.

So far the following tools are available:

* [KRNNT tagger](krnnt) -- Polish tagger based on recurrent neural networks
